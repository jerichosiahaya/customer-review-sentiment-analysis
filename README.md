A customer review is a review of a product or service made by a customer who has purchased and used, or had experience with, the product or service. Customer reviews are a form of customer feedback on electronic commerce and online shopping sites. There are also dedicated review sites, some of which use customer reviews as well as or instead of professional reviews. The reviews may themselves be graded for usefulness or accuracy by other users.

Whether your business is a healthcare practice, auto shop, retail store, or hotel, it can greatly benefit from collecting and sharing customer reviews and testimonials. Multiple studies and surveys have shown the power of customer reviews. Data shows that almost all potential new patients, clients, and shoppers use reviews as a primary factor in determining where to take their business.

<b> The “Local Consumer Review “LCR” Survey 2018” by BrightLocal revealed that 86% of consumers read reviews for local businesses. </b>

Almost all customers seek out recommendations and testimonials before choosing a business, product, and service. They do this because it helps them to establish trust and filter out companies that have a terrible reputation. The LCR survey showed that:

- 57% of consumers will only use a business if it has 4 or more stars

- 80% of 18-34-year-olds have written online reviews – compared to just 41% of consumers over 55

- 91% of 18-34-year-old consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations

Personal recommendations and word-of-mouth referrals were once the primary way for consumers to collect information about businesses. But now, the availability of customer-generated media has made it possible to find reviews in multiple places, and customers trust those reviews almost as much as a review from a friend or family member.

And, reviews do more than build trust and affinity. They can also increase revenue and impact sales. A one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9 percent increase in revenue (study by Harvard Business School). Given comparable prices, travelers are 3.9 times more likely to choose a hotel with a higher review score (study by TrustYou). Collecting and displaying customer reviews needs to be a priority for all businesses.
